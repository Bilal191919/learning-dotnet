# 🚀 .NET Development Roadmap: From Fundamentals to Production-Grade APIs

## 👨‍💻 Professional Objective
I am a dedicated **Computer Science student (4th Semester)** currently undergoing an intensive professional development track to master the .NET ecosystem. This repository serves as a documented portfolio of my technical growth, architectural understanding, and commitment to building scalable, enterprise-level Web APIs.

---

## 📅 Strategic Learning Plan (50-Day Track)
This roadmap has been structured to balance academic responsibilities with high-intensity technical training.

* **Timeline:** 50 Days
* **Daily Focus:** 3-4 Hours of deep work and hands-on coding
* **Key Milestones:** C# Mastery, RESTful Architecture, EF Core Persistence, and Clean Architecture implementation.
